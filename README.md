# hall_players
Identifying candidates for the Baseball Hall of Fame that may have been missed by the voting members of the Baseball Writers Association
of America.

The data set being analyzed can be found (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). I have chosen to focus my analysis
upon 3 of the included files covering batting and pitching statistics from 1871 - 2015 in .csv format. 

I have uploaded the files used forthis analysis also, be sure to update the path variable to the location you have saved these files, if
you choose to download and run it locally.

This project covers everything from Data Wrangling through analysis using the Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
